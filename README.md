An analysis of chosen career sectors for life science PhD programs at Johns Hopkins University

## Background Information
This analysis aims to use a cluster analysis to identify the primary sectors that life science PhD program graduates pursue. in 2017, an article published in [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/12/15/new-calls-clear-easily-accessible-data-phd-program-outcomes-life-sciences) discusses a commitment that institutions made to provide transparent data about life science PhD programs, specifically about admissions and career outcomes. Many students who graduate will not end up in expected faculty positions, so the purpose of the published data is to allow PhD candidates to understand the likelihood of pursuing careers in a specific sector. The [Next Generation Life Sciences Coalition](https://nglscoalition.org/coalition-data/) has compiled data from many university life science programs, allowing students to compare options and understand the statistics before graduating. As a student at Johns Hopkins University, I am curious to understand the different sectors that different PhD candidates pursue in the life sciences. This analysis will group different fields of study into clusters based on postgraduate career sectors.   

## Business Question
What sectors do different Johns Hopkins University PhD life science program graduates pursue, and how can the career center use this information to improve career outcomes? 

## Open Data
This analysis uses open data from the [Next Generation Life Sciences Coalition](https://nglscoalition.org/coalition-data/), specifically [Johns Hopkins University](https://provost.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/09/ADA-Tables.pdf), which provides career outcomes for post graduate and PhD graduates.
